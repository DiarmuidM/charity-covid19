# The impact of Covid-19 on the foundation and dissolution of charitable organisations

This project tracks the impact of Covid-19 on charity sectors worldwide. It uses publicly available data on charity registrations (foundations) and de-registrations (dissolutions) from seven charity jurisdictions: full details on our data sources are <a href="" target=_blank>here</a>.

### Findings

There is a dedicated project website where the latest findings are published, as well as information on the methodology, data sources etc:


### Materials

The project uses Python (a programming language) and Stata (a statistical software package) to collect, clean and analyse publicly available data about charities. These materials are free for you to use, adapt and share for your own purposes:


### Overview

COVID-19 represents an existential threat to many charitable organisations, while simultaneously spurring new, large-scale forms of voluntary activity (Macmillan, 2020). Using comprehensive publicly available data from seven jurisdictions, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on the foundation and dissolution of charitable organisations. We employ an “excess events” analytical approach, comparing the numbers of foundations and dissolutions in 2020 to what we would expect based on the trends from previous years. We reflect on the differential impact of COVID-19 across jurisdictions, as well as attempt to decompose the empirical patterns into two distinct but related factors: the level of applications for foundation and dissolution by charities; and the capacity of the charity regulators to process these applications.
