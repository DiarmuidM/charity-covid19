# Foundations and dissolutions of charitable organisations

## June 2020 Update

Using publicly available data collected the first week of July 2020, the following are the trends in registrations (foundations) and de-registrations (dissolutions) for the three UK charity jurisdictions:
* England and Wales
* Scotland
* Northern Ireland

In addition we analyse registration data for the following jurisdictions:
* Australia

There are two types of analyses presented here:
1. The monthly figures for registrations and de-registrations in 2020, compared to the average figures for 2015-2019.
2. The cumulative number of registrations and de-registrations for 2020, compared to what we expect based on trends for 2015-2019.

The former shows us whether a particular month displays much higher or lower numbers of registrations/de-registrations than is typical for that month; the latter tells us whether the total number of registrations/de-registrations is where we expect it to be based on previous years.

Finally, there are two key processes generating the observed trends:
1. Applications for registration and de-registration by charities.
2. The capacity of the regulators to process and prioritise these applications.

### England and Wales

#### Registrations

The number of new charities has remained steady in England and Wales over the first half of 2020: in fact, registrations were higher than expected in February and March (see figure 1). As a result the total number of new charities is broadly in line with the trend for 2015-2019, with c. 3000 organisations granted charity status by the end of June 2020 (slightly above expectations - see figure 2).

#### De-registrations

The number of charities de-registered (removed from the Register of Charities) is also broadly in line with previous years, though the figures for April-June were more variable than expected. As a result, slightly fewer charities have been de-registered in total by the end of June 2020 (c. 300 less than expected). If there is to be a culling of organisations due to the effects of Covid-19, it has yet to materialise in the data.

### Scotland

#### Registrations

The patterns in monthly registrations for Scotland are similar to those for England and Wales, with a small degree of variation compared to previous years (see figure 5). Though as a result of these monthly trends, there are slightly fewer new charities overall in 2020 than we would expect (c. 100 - see figure 6).

#### De-registrations

Examining de-registrations however, reveals a clear decrease in the monthly and cumulative figures compared to previous years: between February and April 2020, there were fewer charities de-registered each month (figure 7), though the figures for June are in line with expectations. As a result there are considerably fewer de-registrations than expected - see figure 8. It is likely the lower levels of de-registrations are a result of shifting regulatory priorities around the beginning of the pandemic in the UK; for example, case work relating to defaulting charities - those that fail to file their accounts on time - was likely halted for a period, resulting in lower numbers of these organisations losing their charitable status.

### Northern Ireland

Figures for Northern Ireland should be interpreted cautiously, for three reasons:
1. The sector is small compared to the other UK jurisdictions: monthly figures are low and hence display much more variability i.e., it is more difficult to establish what is a *typical* number of registrations for a given month.
2. The regulator is still undertaking work to register charities already in existence; that is, CCNI is calling charities forward in order to register with them. Thus monthly figures include new organisations being formed, and existing charities formalising their registration with the regulator. More information on the regulator's work on this task [here](https://apps.charitycommissionni.org.uk/About_us/Contacting_us/FAQs.aspx#Registration%20begins%20date?).
3. The regulator's ability and capacity to register and remove charities (as well as execute a number of other core functions) has been considerably hampered by a recent court ruling - information [here](https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/news/legal-update/).

For these reasons we are reluctant to interpret the observed trends - hopefully these figures will either be revised or clarified at a future date.

### Australia

The number of registrations is below what's expected for each month in the first half of 2020 (see figure 13); this trend may be explained by Australia's proximity to the regions first affected by Covid-19 in early January 2020.[^1]

As a result, there are roughly half as many charities registered in the first half of 2020 than we would expect - see figure 14.

[^1]: The especially low figures for June may be an artefact of when the data were downloaded (2020-07-11), and thus potentially revised upwards at a later date.
