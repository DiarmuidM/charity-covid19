# Foundations and dissolutions of charitable organisations

## August 2020 Update

Using publicly available data collected on 17 September 2020, the following are the trends in registrations (foundations) and de-registrations (dissolutions) for the following jurisdictions:
* England and Wales
* Scotland
* Northern Ireland
* Australia (registrations only)
* New Zealand
* United States of America (registrations only)
* Canada

There are two types of analyses presented here:
1. The monthly figures for registrations and de-registrations in 2020, compared to the average figures for 2015-2019.
2. The cumulative number of registrations and de-registrations for 2020, compared to what we expect based on trends for 2015-2019.

The former shows us whether a particular month displays much higher or lower numbers of registrations/de-registrations than is typical for that month; the latter tells us whether the total number of registrations/de-registrations is where we expect it to be based on previous years.

Finally, keep in mind two of the key processes generating the observed trends:
1. Applications for registration and de-registration by charities.
2. The capacity of the regulators to process and prioritise these applications.

More information on our methodology can be found here: [ [LINK] ]({{site.url}}/methodology)

**NOTE:** In many cases data for the latest month will be incomplete, due to the timing of the data collection.

### England and Wales

#### Registrations

The number of new charities has remained steady in England and Wales throughout 2020: in fact, registrations were higher than expected in February and March (see figure 1). As a result the total number of new charities is broadly in line with the trend for 2015-2019, with c. 3500 organisations granted charity status by the end of August 2020 (as expectated - see figure 2).

*Figure 2. Cumulative registrations of charities - England and Wales*

#### De-registrations

The number of charities de-registered (removed from the Register of Charities) is also broadly in line with previous years, though the figures for April-July were more variable than expected. As a result, slightly fewer charities have been de-registered in total so far in 2020 (c. 500 less than expected). If there is to be a culling of organisations due to the effects of Covid-19, it has yet to materialise in the data.

### Scotland

#### Registrations

The patterns in monthly registrations for Scotland are similar to those for England and Wales, with a small degree of variation compared to previous years (see figure 5). As a result of these monthly trends, there are very slightly fewer new charities overall in 2020 than we would expect (figure 6).

*Figure 6. Cumulative registrations of charities - Scotland*

#### De-registrations

Examining de-registrations however, reveals a clear decrease in the monthly and cumulative figures compared to previous years: between March and May, there were fewer charities de-registered each month, ditto July (figure 7). As a result there are considerably fewer de-registrations than expected - see figure 8. It is likely the lower levels of de-registrations are a result of shifting regulatory priorities around the beginning of the pandemic in the UK; for example, case work relating to defaulting charities - those that fail to file their accounts on time - was likely halted for a period, resulting in lower numbers of these organisations losing their charitable status.

### Northern Ireland

Figures for Northern Ireland should be interpreted cautiously, for three reasons:
1. The sector is small compared to the other UK jurisdictions: monthly figures are low and hence display much more variability i.e., it is more difficult to establish what is a *typical* number of registrations for a given month.
2. The regulator is still undertaking work to register charities already in existence; that is, CCNI is calling charities forward in order to register with them. Thus monthly figures include new organisations being formed, and existing charities formalising their registration with the regulator. More information on the regulator's work on this task [here](https://apps.charitycommissionni.org.uk/About_us/Contacting_us/FAQs.aspx#Registration%20begins%20date?).
3. The regulator's ability and capacity to register and remove charities (as well as execute a number of other core functions) has been considerably hampered by a recent court ruling - information [here](https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/news/legal-update/).

For these reasons we are reluctant to interpret the observed trends - hopefully these figures will either be revised or clarified at a future date.

#### Registrations

### Australia

#### Registrations

The number of registrations is below what's expected for each month so far in 2020 (see figure 13); this trend may be explained by Australia's proximity to the regions first affected by Covid-19 in early January 2020.[^1]

As a result, there are roughly half as many charities registered in the first half of 2020 than we would expect - see figure 14.

[^1]: The especially low figures for July may be an artefact of when the data were downloaded (2020-09-17), and thus potentially revised upwards at a later date.

### New Zealand

#### Registrations

The number of registrations is below what's expected for the months March-July 2020 (see figure 15); this trend may be explained by New Zealand's proximity to the regions first affected by Covid-19 in early 2020, and the timing of its lockdown measures.

As a result, there are c. 300 fewer charities registered in 2020 than we would expect - see figure 16.

*Figure 16. Cumulative registrations of charities - New Zealand*

![Cumulative registrations]({{site.url}}/figures/nz-monthly-cumulative-registrations-2020-09-17.png)

#### De-registrations

The number of de-registrations is below what's expected for each month in 2020 (see figure 17), resulting in far fewer than expected by this period in the year (figure 18).

### Canada

#### Registrations

The number of registrations is below what's expected for each month in 2020 (see figure 19); as a result, there are roughly 1/4 as many charities registered in 2020 than we would expect - see figure 20.

*Figure 19. Monthly registrations of charities - Canada*

*Figure 20. Cumulative registrations of charities - Canada*

#### De-registrations

The latest copy of the data only includes de-registrations for the first three months of the year (figures 21 and 22).

### United States of America

#### Registrations

The number of registrations has remained in line with expectations over the first six months of 2020 (figure 23). As a result, the total number of new charities is similar to previous years (figure 24).
