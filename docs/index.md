# Welcome

This website publishes analyses of the impact Covid-19 is having on charity sectors worldwide. It is based on work conducted by Dr Diarmuid McDonnell, University of Manchester and Professor Alasdair Rutherford, University of Stirling.

Using comprehensive publicly available data from seven jurisdictions, we examine the impact of Covid-19 on the foundation and dissolution of charitable organisations. We do this at two levels:
1. Macro-level analyses focus on trends and patterns occuring at the national/jurisdictional level. For example, how many new charities are being formed in Scotland on a monthly basis in 2020?
2. Meso-level analyses disaggregate the macro-level trends by important organisational and geographical factors. For example, are new Scottish charities more likely to be formed in certain areas, or to serve certain beneficiary groups?
