# The impact of COVID-19 on the foundation and dissolution of charitable organisations: A cross-national comparison

## Paper notes

### So what?

* International perspective on the impact of the pandemic, moving beyond country-specific analyses (NVSQ references).
* Nonprofits play a central role in society, particularly at a community level in terms of building resilience etc. [Refine this point using Paarlberg et al., 2020 and Clifford, 2018 literature]

1. Analysis:
	* Change timeframe for annual and ITSA analyses (April 2020-March 2021 i.e. first year of pandemic)
2. Implications
	* Data: timely, accurate and open data are critical for understanding the impact on charitable sectors and guiding policy and philanthropic responses.
	* Regulation: clearly an impact on regulators capacity to conduct its operations to time and at scale.
	* Charitable activity: has it been curtailed?
3. Further research:
	* Fine-grained look at the community level impact
4. Limitations:
	* Difficult to unpick reason for lower levels of removals.
	* In some jurisdictions charities do not have to register with a regulator (i.e., charitable activity continues but outwith regualtory oversight). Ties in to the mutual aid and philanthropic responses that have been documented.
