        Ulidia Housing Association Ltd provides quality, affordable housing accommodation and other support services to people in need.

    </p>
        <p class="pcg-charity-details__continue collapse" id="charityBenifits">
             facilities and amenities for the prevention or relief of poverty or for those in need by reason of youth, age, ill health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage
•	Any other charitable object that can be carried out by an Industrial and Provident Society registered as a housing association by the Department.

The Association has 4 Strategic Priorities and Objectives

1.	To enhance the quality of our services to residents living in our accommodation

4.	To maximise the potential of all human, financial and material resources and promote the work of the Association to enhance our profile and reputation.

The Association promotes community development by:

Developing accommodation in rural and urban areas where housing need has been identified. This includes two ‘Shared Future Housing’ projects aimed at addressing the vision of shared communities in a deeply divided society.
Promoting the Association’s Good Neighbour Agreement which is based on the principles of equality and respect for diversity. All tenants are encouraged to sign up to the Agreement which aims to increase community spirit and is based upon the following principles:
•	Respecting neighbours and their property
•	Caring for the vulnerable and less fortunate
•	Everyone having the same rights regardless of cultural background or religious and political beliefs
•	Adults respecting that children have a right to play in a safe and happy environment
•	Residents respecting the environment and striving to keep it clean and tidy.

Implementing our Tenant Involvement Strategy which focuses on improving tenant consultation and involvement through a combination of formally constituted Community Associations, Community Champions, a Housing Advisory Group and Tenant Involvement Register.
