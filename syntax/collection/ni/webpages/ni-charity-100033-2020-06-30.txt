What benefit flows from this purpose?

Dreamscheme Northern Ireland:

•	Provides young people in disadvantaged areas with attractive alternatives to risk taking behaviours, anti-social activity, civil unrest and crime
•	Connects young people with their local communities and encourage active, positive citizenship on the part of young people (e.g. through providing community volunteering opportunities)
•	Provides the statutory authorities (e.g. police, health and emergency services) with opportunities to connect with at risk young people in a positive manner
•	Challenges racist and sectarian behaviour, combats prejudice and creates a safe space for young people to explore ideas
•	Affirms young people, encourages ambition, builds potential and encourages a sense of self-worth

Can we demonstrate benefit?

“The work that Dreamscheme does is having a real positive impact in engaging young people most at risk and helping to reduce anti-social behaviour in the area.  I wish that there could be more projects like Dreamscheme NI operating across other neighbourhoods of Castlereagh”. 
Derek Martin, Commander Castlereagh, Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)

We undertake surveys of the young people who attend Dreamscheme and regularly obtain feedback from the PSNI and other funders/partners on the benefits delivered as a result of our activities (mostly through independent evaluations).  

A recent evaluation report (commissioned by Castlereagh Borough Council Leisure Services) found that: young people on our restorative justice placements had experienced a positive shift in attitudes toward offending; community work by young people had resulted in better community relations and a greater sense of ‘community safety’; the scheme had improved the general outlook and self-esteem of young participants; workshops had helped to change attitudes to harmful attitudes and activities; the outings ‘Reward Points’ programme had been highly valued by young people many of whom would not otherwise have been able to participate in the activities on offer. 

Is there any harm or possibility of harm and, if so, is it outweighed by the benefit?

The only harm that we have identified through our risk assessment is the possibility of harm to our staff and volunteers at the hands of one or more young people but this is a moderate to low risk and is outweighed by the substantial and demonstrable benefits delivered through our projects and activities.

Who is the benefit for?

The young people that Dreamscheme serves are aged 13 - 18 years and include:

•	Young people with little or no involvement in any other youth groups or organisations
•	Young people who are vulnerable to exploitation by paramilitary organisations
•	Those who have been involved in previous political unrest and / or violence 
•	Those hanging around hot spots late at night with potential for anti-social behaviour 
•	Young people engaged in risk taking activities e.g. drug and alcohol misuse

                    <p>
        We organise drop in youth club programmes, community work projects and street outreach work for young people in Castlereagh, Newtownbreda, Cairnshill, Carryduff, Braniel and Belvoir Estates.  

• Drop in youth clubs:  These take place on one or two nights a week in each area
 
• Community work:  This results in young people gaining ‘Reward Points’
    </p>
        <p class="pcg-charity-details__continue collapse" id="charityActivities">
             and include:
 
- Visiting older people in nursing homes and in their own homes, talking with housebound residents, helping with outings, gardening, other craft projects
- Environmental projects such as litter picking, cleaning graffiti, cleaning streams, repairing fences, painting community murals, planting flowerbeds and tidying children’s play parks
 
• Personal development workshops, activities and visits
Subjects include: active citizenship; celebrating diversity; sectarianism; mental health; relationships; drugs and alcohol.  We organise community service places for young offenders engaged in Restorative Justice Schemes.  We also organise a Leaders in Training Programme to empower young people to become young leaders and community volunteers
 
• Diversionary and special activities
We organise special activities designed to divert young people into positive activity at times of heightened community tension such as the Summer marching season.  
 
• Social, leisure and fun trips
Young people can trade in Reward Points gained through their hard work to attend outings and activities.  These trips also help to build friendships and encourage young people to learn new skills and activities
 
Some examples of our achievements
• Positive community murals painted near the Ice Bowl, Dundonald and on the Braniel Estate
• Flowerbeds and baskets planted at Braniel Estate and Newtownbreda and a Dreamscheme ‘Welcome to Newtownbreda’ sign with the strapline ‘Young people can do wonderful things’
• An evening of intergenerational activities and an exploration of other cultures involving ethnic food and dance at Belvoir Activity Centre
