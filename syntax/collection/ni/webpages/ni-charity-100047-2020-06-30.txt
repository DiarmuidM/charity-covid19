        Public Benefit Statement of The Big House (Ireland)
For each of our purposes the primary area of benefit is the Island of Ireland. Where reference is made to “young people” this means young people, primarily aged between 11 and 18 years, regardless of their beliefs or background.
The benefits of our purposes are evidenced through feedback received
    </p>
        <p class="pcg-charity-details__continue collapse" id="charityBenifits">
             or collected from young people who have participated in activities run or supported by The Big House; from their parents or group/church leaders; or from parents or leaders who received training, advice or resources from The Big House.
a) The benefits of this purpose include the positive view of self and others, help and support in changing harmful thought patterns or behaviours, and healing from illnesses or harmful experiences which may be experienced as people begin or are encouraged in following the Christian faith.
The beneficiaries include the young people themselves, their families and communities.
b) The benefits of this purpose include increasing the knowledge, understanding and skills of parents, leaders and volunteers responsible for, or engaging with, young people, particularly regarding issues which can cause distress or difficulty and the improved care of young as a result of our training or support.
The primary beneficiaries are the young people whose parents or leaders receive training or educational resources. An incidental benefit is the enhancement of the skills of those who receive training.
c) The benefits of this purpose are relief from distress, improvement of wellbeing and improvement in relationships of young people.
The primary beneficiaries are the young people who receive support or counselling and their families, friends and communities. Those involved in providing counselling or pastoral support may incidentally benefit from the training, supervision and experience they gain.
d) The benefits of this purpose are the improvement in self-esteem, wellbeing and social interaction gained through involvement in groups and activities. 
The primary beneficiaries are the young people who are enabled to take part in groups, events or organisations due to their leaders receiving training, support or resources. Leaders receiving training may also benefit by increasing their skills.
 e) The benefits of this purpose are improvement in physical and mental wellbeing, and development of social skills and self-esteem.
The beneficiaries are primarily the young people who take part in activities run by or with help from The Big House. Their parents, friends and communities may also benefit.
f) The benefits of this purpose include the participation of young people in leisure activities, informal education, promotion of the Christian faith, counselling and support, or respite from difficult situations.
The beneficiaries are the young people and their leaders who attend residential programmes with them. Other organisations who share similar charitable purposes may benefit from the use of facilities suitable for their residential programmes. 
An incidental private benefit may be the receipt of training and salaries for such employees as are required to operate the facilities. 
 g) the promotion of such other exclusively charitable purposes according to the law of Northern Ireland as may from time to time be determined by the Directors.
The benefits of this purpose are the improvement in physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of young people resulting from programmes developed and delivered in response to their needs and those of their leaders in order to care for them. The primary beneficiaries will be the young people who participate in these activities or whose parents or leaders receive assistance.

             supporting and providing resources for parents and youth or church leaders who are engaging with such young people as part of existing organisations or programmes which are inspired by or promote the Christian faith. The support and resources provided include a counselling service for young people, short-term residential youth programmes, and training and advice for youth leaders, church leaders or parents. The counselling service is provided by experienced professional counsellors and works within the guidelines of the BACP and ACC. Our residential camps and weekends offer young people an enjoyable programme of activities and include opportunities to openly and honestly explore issues which may be affecting them, in a safe and caring environment. They are run by large teams of trained and experienced volunteers from The Big House. The training and advice we provide are informed by practical Biblical theology, professional expertise, personal experience, and examples of best practice.
