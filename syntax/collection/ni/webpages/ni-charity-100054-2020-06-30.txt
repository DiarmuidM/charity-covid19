        The direct benefits which flow from our purposes are that the tools taught to the parents promote recovery in the sufferer. It helps them begin to change their distorted thinking and gives them a new healthier perspective. Teaching the psychology of change to carers allows them to promote change in the sufferer. 
Victoria who underwent treatment at
    </p>
        <p class="pcg-charity-details__continue collapse" id="charityBenifits">
             the New Maudsley states &quot;I noticed a distinct change in my parents approach to my illness following their training, it was the turning point in my illness.&quot;
Other benefits flowing from the purposes include improved health outcomes and reduced levels of anxiety and stress to carers by enabling them to cope with day to day living with someone suffering from an eating disorder, thus reducing the amount of time lost through absences from work, trips to doctors and hospitals, and most importantly maintaining a strong family unit thus preventing marital breakups.
Benefits will be demonstrated through: 
-feedback from our carers and a regular independent evaluation of our services;
-For instance, the founder members of the charity Ivan &amp; Dianne Shaw were fortunate to receive the benefit of The New Maudsley course while their daughter was in hospital, they stated “The support we received through The New Maudsley Method was like a life jacket to us, before the course we felt like we were drowning, constantly battling to get help for our daughter and not knowing which way to turn, following the carers course we felt for the first time hopeful, we were taught the necessary skills we needed to manage our daughter and feeling supported helped us to support our daughter. Victoria is now on the road to recovery”;
-The New Maudsley Method which we intend to use has been running for 20 yrs in London and headed by Professor Janet Treasure Phd FRCP FRCPsych, who has vast experience in the area of eating disorders on a UK and European basis.  The ethos of both her research and clinical practice is to work collaboratively with carers and users and to use new technology to further this endeavour.
No harm will occur from the courses.
Our beneficiaries are the carers of anyone in NI who has suffered from an eating disorder and the sufferers of eating disorders by making their carer’s more able to care for them.   The general public, health care providers and statutory bodies benefit indirectly by increasing awareness and education in the area and reducing the need for lengthy hospital stays for sufferers of eating disorders.
Private benefits may be acquired by the facilitators as they will receive cover towards any travel expenses, however, this will be incidental and necessary in order to continue with the running of the training courses.
